# Bank_Loan_Prediction

Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict whether a bank loan will be approved or not based on various customer attributes.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Building and fine-tuning machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier etc.).
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
Prediction: Making predictions on new data to determine loan approval likelihood.

Achieved an accuracy rate of 90% in Gradient Boosting Classifier.
